Reverse proxy\
A Nginx HTTPS reverse proxy is an intermediary proxy service which takes
a client request, passes it on to one or more servers, and subsequently
delivers the server's response back to the client. In our case for key
management keosd has to be launched as daemon behind reverse
proxy(nginx) nginx will be used to enable password based authentication.
